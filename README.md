# SimulatingProjectileTrajectory!

This program implements a time stepping scheme that descibes the movement of a projectile being launched

The projectiles motion was descibed by the following equations:

Additonally, the Vertical Velocity (i.e. relative to the horizontal wind velocity) of the projectile, was described by:

# Result 

The dot in the figure below is the projectile. There are multiple dots as the figure is illustrating the position as each time step. 

The projectile starts at the bottom left (0,0) and is launched to the right. The projectile then falls and lands on the target (the red cicle).
